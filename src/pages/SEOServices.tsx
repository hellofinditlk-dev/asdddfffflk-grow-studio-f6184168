const faqs = [
  { q: "What is SEO?", a: "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing your website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) like Google. It involves on-page optimization (meta tags, content, headings), technical SEO (site speed, mobile-friendliness, crawlability), off-page SEO (backlinks, citations), and content marketing — all working together to improve your website's visibility and drive organic traffic." },
  { q: "Why is SEO important for businesses in Sri Lanka?", a: "Sri Lanka has become a search-first economy where customers rely heavily on Google before making purchasing decisions. If your business doesn't appear on the first page of Google, you're losing customers to competitors who do. SEO drives free, consistent, high-intent traffic — making it the most cost-effective long-term marketing investment." },
  { q: "What is the difference between on-page and off-page SEO?", a: "On-page SEO covers everything on your website — meta tags, content, headings, site speed, mobile optimization, internal links, and schema markup. Off-page SEO focuses on external factors like backlinks, social signals, local citations, and brand mentions that build your site's authority and trust with Google." },
  { q: "How long does SEO take to show results?", a: "SEO is a long-term strategy. Most businesses start seeing noticeable improvements in rankings and traffic within 3–6 months. However, competitive industries may take longer. The results compound over time, making SEO one of the highest-ROI marketing channels available." },
  { q: "Do you guarantee first page rankings?", a: "No ethical SEO agency can guarantee #1 rankings, as Google's algorithm considers 200+ factors. However, we consistently achieve top 10 rankings for targeted keywords through proven white-hat strategies. We focus on driving real traffic and leads, not empty promises." },
  { q: "Is SEO better than Google Ads?", a: "Both have their place. Google Ads delivers instant visibility but stops when you stop paying. SEO takes longer to build but delivers free, ongoing traffic that compounds over time. We recommend combining both — Google Ads for immediate leads and SEO for sustainable long-term growth and authority." },
  { q: "What is local SEO?", a: "Local SEO optimizes your online presence for location-based searches like 'near me' queries and city-specific terms. It includes Google Business Profile optimization, local citations, review management, and location-targeted content. Critical for businesses serving specific areas in Sri Lanka." },
  { q: "Do you offer local SEO for businesses in Sri Lanka?", a: "Yes! Local SEO is one of our core strengths. We optimize your Google Business Profile, build local citations, target location-specific keywords, and manage review strategies to help you rank for searches like 'near me' and city-based queries across all major cities in Sri Lanka." },
  { q: "What is technical SEO?", a: "Technical SEO focuses on improving your website's backend infrastructure — site speed, mobile responsiveness, crawlability, indexing, schema markup, XML sitemaps, SSL security, and Core Web Vitals. These factors directly impact how Google discovers, crawls, and ranks your pages." },
  { q: "How much does SEO cost in Sri Lanka?", a: "Our SEO packages start from LKR 25,000/month, making professional SEO accessible for small businesses. Unlike paid ads where you pay per click, SEO traffic is free once you rank. The cost depends on competition, number of keywords, and scope of work needed." },
  { q: "Can SEO increase sales?", a: "Yes — significantly. SEO drives high-intent organic traffic from users actively searching for your products or services. This traffic has much higher conversion rates than social media or display advertising because users are already in a buying mindset. Businesses that invest in SEO consistently see increased leads and revenue." },
  { q: "What is the best SEO company in Sri Lanka?", a: "Cypher Digital is a leading SEO company in Sri Lanka providing comprehensive search engine optimization services including keyword research, on-page optimization, technical SEO, content marketing, link building, and local SEO — all designed to improve rankings, drive organic traffic, and generate consistent leads for businesses across all industries." },
