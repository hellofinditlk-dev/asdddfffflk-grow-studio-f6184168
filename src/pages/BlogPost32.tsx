              Sri Lanka's tourism industry is experiencing a strong recovery, and TikTok has emerged as one of the most effective platforms for hotels, resorts, and tourism businesses to attract both local and international guests. The visual, immersive nature of TikTok makes it perfectly suited for showcasing travel experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Why TikTok Works for Tourism:</strong> Travel content is among the most popular categories on TikTok globally. Users actively search for destination inspiration, hotel reviews, hidden gems, and travel tips on the platform. A single compelling video of your hotel's ocean view, a unique dining experience, or a scenic tour route can reach millions of potential travelers organically.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Content Ideas for Hotels:</strong> The most successful hotel TikTok accounts create a mix of content types. Room tours and property walkthroughs give potential guests a real feel for the experience. Behind-the-scenes content showing kitchen preparation, staff interactions, and setup processes creates authenticity. Guest experience videos — sunrise views, pool scenes, spa moments — trigger emotional desire to visit.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Leveraging Local Content:</strong> Sri Lanka's natural beauty is a massive asset on TikTok. Content featuring Sigiriya, Ella, Mirissa, Galle Fort, and other iconic destinations consistently performs well. Hotels can create content that combines their property with nearby attractions, positioning themselves as the ideal base for exploring.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Targeting International Tourists:</strong> TikTok's global reach means your content can reach travelers in the UK, Australia, Europe, India, and other key source markets for Sri Lankan tourism. Using English-language content with popular travel hashtags puts your property in front of travelers actively planning their next trip.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">TikTok Ads for Bookings:</strong> Beyond organic content, TikTok's paid advertising platform allows hotels to run targeted campaigns to specific demographics and geographic locations. Conversion campaigns can drive traffic directly to your booking page, while awareness campaigns build brand recognition among future travelers.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Influencer Partnerships:</strong> Collaborating with travel influencers — both local and international — can dramatically boost your hotel's visibility. Invite influencers for complimentary stays in exchange for TikTok content. The authentic, first-person perspective of an influencer staying at your property is far more persuasive than traditional advertising.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Seasonal Campaigns:</strong> Align your TikTok content with peak booking seasons, holiday periods, and special events. Pre-season content creates anticipation and early bookings, while real-time content during busy periods showcases social proof and FOMO (fear of missing out).
