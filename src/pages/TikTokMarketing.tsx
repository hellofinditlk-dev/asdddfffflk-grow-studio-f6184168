const faqs = [
  { q: "What is TikTok marketing?", a: "TikTok marketing involves using short-form video content to promote products and services, build brand awareness, engage audiences, and drive traffic and sales. It includes organic content strategy, paid TikTok advertising, influencer collaborations, and trend-based content creation." },
  { q: "How much does TikTok marketing cost in Sri Lanka?", a: "TikTok marketing is highly flexible. Small businesses can start from LKR 30,000–100,000/month, medium businesses typically invest LKR 100,000–300,000/month, and larger campaigns start from LKR 300,000+. We design custom packages based on your goals and budget." },
  { q: "Is TikTok effective for businesses in Sri Lanka?", a: "Yes! TikTok has millions of active users in Sri Lanka with rapidly growing adoption among Gen Z and Millennials. The platform's algorithm allows even small businesses to reach massive audiences organically, making it one of the most cost-effective marketing channels available." },
  { q: "How soon will I see results from TikTok marketing?", a: "Organic content can gain traction within the first week if it aligns with trends. Paid campaigns typically show measurable results within 7–14 days. We recommend at least 4–6 weeks for a comprehensive strategy to fully optimize and scale." },
  { q: "Do I need a large following to succeed on TikTok?", a: "No! Unlike other platforms, TikTok's algorithm pushes content to new audiences regardless of follower count. A well-crafted video can reach hundreds of thousands of viewers even from an account with zero followers." },
  { q: "What types of businesses benefit from TikTok marketing?", a: "Hotels & tourism, e-commerce & retail, education & study abroad, restaurants & cafes, SMEs & startups, beauty & wellness, and many more.

  { q: "What is the difference between TikTok Ads and Facebook Ads?", a: "TikTok Ads offer significantly lower CPM, higher organic reach potential, and stronger engagement rates—especially with younger audiences. Facebook Ads provide more mature targeting options and broader demographics. The best strategy often combines both platforms." },
  { q: "Do you handle influencer collaborations?", a: "Yes! We identify and connect your brand with relevant Sri Lankan TikTok influencers and niche content creators to build trust, reach targeted audiences, and increase conversions through authentic recommendations." },
  { q: "What is the best TikTok marketing agency in Sri Lanka?", a: "Cypher Digital is a leading TikTok marketing agency in Sri Lanka providing viral content creation, strategic ad campaigns, influencer marketing, and data-driven optimization that delivers measurable leads and sales for businesses across all industries." },

Combining TikTok marketing with our full Social Media Management Sri Lanka service gives you a unified content strategy across TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. This multi-platform approach increases brand visibility, repurposes viral TikTok content across channels, and delivers stronger ROI than running TikTok in isolation." },
  { q: "Do you offer Social Media Management Sri Lanka along with TikTok content creation?", a: "Yes. As a leading Social Media Management Sri Lanka agency, we provide end-to-end management — TikTok video production, posting calendars, community engagement, hashtag research, and analytics reporting — all under one team so your brand voice stays consistent across every platform." },
  { q: "How does TikTok fit into a Social Media Management Sri Lanka strategy?", a: "TikTok is now a core pillar of any modern Social Media Management Sri Lanka strategy. We use TikTok for top-of-funnel discovery and viral reach, Instagram Reels for nurturing, and Facebook for retargeting and lead generation — creating a complete sales funnel powered by short-form video." },
