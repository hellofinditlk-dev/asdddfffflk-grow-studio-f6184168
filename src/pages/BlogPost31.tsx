              Influencer marketing on TikTok has become one of the most effective strategies for brands looking to build trust, reach targeted audiences, and drive conversions in Sri Lanka. Unlike traditional advertising, influencer content feels authentic and relatable — which is exactly why it converts so well.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Why TikTok Influencers are Different:</strong> TikTok creators have built highly engaged communities around specific niches — food, fashion, travel, education, fitness, and more. Their followers trust their recommendations in a way that feels more like a friend's suggestion than an advertisement. This trust translates directly into higher conversion rates.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Finding the Right Influencers:</strong> The biggest follower count doesn't always mean the best results. Micro-influencers (10,000–100,000 followers) often deliver higher engagement rates and more targeted reach than mega-influencers. Look for creators whose audience demographics match your target customer, whose content style aligns with your brand, and who have genuine engagement (not inflated by bots).
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Collaboration Strategies:</strong> The most effective TikTok influencer campaigns give creators creative freedom. Instead of scripting every detail, provide a brief with key messages and let the influencer adapt it to their authentic style. Formats that work well include product reviews, "day in my life" featuring your product, challenges, tutorials, and unboxing videos.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Spark Ads — The Best of Both Worlds:</strong> TikTok's Spark Ads allow brands to boost influencer content as paid ads while keeping the organic feel. This means you get the authenticity of influencer content combined with the targeting precision of paid advertising — a powerful combination for Sri Lankan businesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Measuring ROI:</strong> Track influencer campaigns using unique discount codes, UTM links, and TikTok's built-in analytics. Key metrics to monitor include video views, engagement rate, click-through rate, conversions, and cost per acquisition. Always compare results against your other marketing channels to understand relative performance.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Local Market Considerations:</strong> Sri Lanka's TikTok influencer landscape is rapidly maturing. Content in Sinhala and Tamil often generates higher engagement for local businesses than English-only content. Regional influencers in cities like Kandy, Galle, and Jaffna can help reach audiences outside Colombo effectively.
