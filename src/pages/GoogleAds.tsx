const faqs = [
  { q: "What is Google Ads?", a: "Google Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising platform where businesses bid on keywords to display ads on Google search results, YouTube, Gmail, and partner websites. You only pay when someone clicks on your ad, making it one of the most cost-effective digital advertising methods available." },
  { q: "How much does Google Ads cost in Sri Lanka?", a: "Google Ads works on a pay-per-click model. We recommend a minimum ad spend of LKR 50,000/month depending on your industry competition. Cost per click varies by keyword competitiveness — some industries may cost LKR 20–50 per click while competitive keywords can cost more. Our management fee is separate from the ad spend." },
  { q: "Is Google Ads effective in Sri Lanka?", a: "Yes — Google Ads is one of the most effective digital marketing channels in Sri Lanka because it targets users who are actively searching for your products or services. This high-intent targeting means better conversion rates compared to most other advertising methods." },
  { q: "How is Google Ads different from Facebook Ads?", a: "Google Ads captures people actively searching for your product or service (intent-based marketing), while Facebook Ads targets people based on interests and behaviors (interrupt marketing). Google Ads has higher conversion rates for search queries, while Facebook excels at brand awareness. We recommend using both for maximum results." },
  { q: "How long does it take to set up a Google Ads campaign?", a: "We can have your campaign live within 24–48 hours. However, proper keyword research, competitor analysis, and strategy planning takes 3–5 business days for optimal results." },
  { q: "How soon will I see results from Google Ads?", a: "Google Ads delivers immediate visibility — your ads can appear on Google within hours of campaign launch. Most clients start seeing clicks and leads within the first 24–48 hours. However, we recommend 2–4 weeks of optimization for consistent, scalable results." },
  { q: "Do you provide Google Ads reports?", a: "Yes, you'll receive detailed monthly reports covering clicks, impressions, cost per click (CPC), conversions, cost per conversion, Quality Score improvements, and ROI analysis with actionable recommendations." },
  { q: "Can you help with my existing Google Ads account?", a: "Absolutely. We offer free audits of existing accounts to identify wasted spend, poor keyword targeting, and optimization opportunities before we take over management." },
  { q: "Is Google Ads suitable for small businesses in Sri Lanka?", a: "Definitely. Google Ads lets you set your own daily budget, so you only spend what you can afford. Even with a modest budget of LKR 50,000/month, you can target high-intent local searches and generate quality leads cost-effectively." },
  { q: "What types of Google Ads campaigns do you manage?", a: "We manage all Google Ads campaign types including Search Ads, Display Ads, YouTube Video Ads, Shopping Ads for ecommerce, and App Promotion campaigns. We recommend the best campaign mix based on your business goals and budget." },
  { q: "Can Google Ads increase sales?", a: "Yes — significantly. Google Ads targets users with high purchase intent, meaning they're actively looking for what you offer. With proper keyword targeting, compelling ad copy, and optimized landing pages, Google Ads consistently delivers strong sales results for businesses across all industries in Sri Lanka." },
  { q: "What is the best Google Ads agency in Sri Lanka?", a: "Cypher Digital is a leading Google Ads agency in Sri Lanka providing data-driven PPC strategies, comprehensive keyword research, conversion tracking, and continuous campaign optimization that delivers measurable leads and sales for businesses across all industries." },
