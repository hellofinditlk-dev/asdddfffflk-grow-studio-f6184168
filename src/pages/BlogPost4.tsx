            <p>Looking for a results-driven <Link to="/" className="text-primary font-semibold hover:underline">digital marketing agencies in Sri Lanka</Link>? This guide explains the strategy that actually moves the needle for Sri Lankan businesses.</p>
            <p>Facebook Ads has become one of the most powerful digital marketing tools for businesses in Sri Lanka. With advanced targeting options, scalable budgets, and measurable results, Facebook advertising allows brands to reach the right audience at the right time.</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional marketing, Facebook Ads enables businesses to target users based on interests, behavior, demographics, and online activity. This makes campaigns more efficient and reduces wasted ad spend.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages of Facebook Ads is lead generation. Businesses can collect inquiries directly through instant forms, WhatsApp integration, or landing pages. This makes it easier to convert interest into real customers.</p>
            <p>Creative quality also plays a major role in campaign success. Strong visuals, clear messaging, and compelling offers significantly impact performance. Testing different creatives helps identify what resonates best with the audience.</p>
            <p>Another key factor is campaign optimization. Successful advertisers continuously monitor performance, adjust targeting, test creatives, and refine budgets. This data-driven approach leads to better results over time.</p>
            <p>Many businesses struggle because they rely only on boosting posts instead of running structured campaigns. A proper strategy includes funnel stages such as awareness, consideration, and conversion campaigns.</p>
