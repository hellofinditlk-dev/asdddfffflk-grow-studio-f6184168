const faqs = [
  { q: "What is video production?", a: "Video production is the complete process of creating video content — from planning and scripting to filming, editing, and delivering the final product. It encompasses all creative and technical aspects needed to produce engaging visual content for marketing, advertising, social media, and brand communication." },
  { q: "What types of videos do you produce?", a: "We produce promotional videos, social media reels (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts), brand story videos, product demos, testimonial videos, event coverage, ad creatives for Facebook and Google campaigns, corporate videos, and aerial drone footage. Each video is customized for your specific goals and platform." },
  { q: "How long does a video project take?", a: "Simple social media videos and reels can be delivered within 48–72 hours. Larger productions like brand videos, commercials, or corporate profiles typically take 1–2 weeks from concept to final delivery, depending on complexity." },
  { q: "Do you handle filming or just editing?", a: "We offer both! We handle the complete process from concept development and scripting to professional filming and post-production editing. We can also work with footage you provide. Our team uses professional cameras, lighting, and audio equipment for cinematic quality." },
  { q: "What formats do you deliver?", a: "We deliver videos in multiple formats optimized for each platform — square (1:1) for Instagram feed, vertical (9:16) for Reels/Stories/TikTok, landscape (16:9) for YouTube/Facebook, and any custom ratio you need. All files are delivered in high resolution." },
  { q: "Can you create videos for my ad campaigns?", a: "Absolutely! Ad creative videos are one of our specialties. We create thumb-stopping video ads designed specifically for Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Google ad campaigns with proven formats that drive clicks and conversions." },
  { q: "Is video production affordable for small businesses?", a: "Yes! We offer flexible per-video pricing and bundle packages designed for Sri Lankan small businesses. Quick-turnaround reels start from just LKR 15,000. You don't need a massive budget to get professional, scroll-stopping video content." },
  { q: "Why is video important for digital marketing?", a: "Video generates 3x more engagement than static images, increases conversion rates by up to 80%, and is prioritized by social media algorithms. It's the most consumed content format online and essential for building brand trust, driving sales, and staying competitive in digital marketing." },
  { q: "Do you provide scriptwriting and storyboarding?", a: "Yes, we offer complete pre-production services including creative concept development, scriptwriting, storyboarding, and shot planning. This ensures every video has a clear narrative, strong messaging, and professional structure before filming begins." },
  { q: "What is the difference between traditional and digital-first video production?", a: "Traditional production focuses on TV commercials and large-scale shoots with big budgets. Digital-first production focuses on platform-optimized content — short-form videos, social media reels, and ad creatives designed for mobile viewing and online engagement. Digital-first is faster, more affordable, and scalable." },
  { q: "Can video production increase my sales?", a: "Yes — significantly. Professional video content increases engagement, builds trust, and drives conversions across all marketing channels. Product videos can increase purchase intent by up to 85%, and video ads consistently outperform static image ads in click-through and conversion rates." },
  { q: "What is the best video production company in Sri Lanka?", a: "Cypher Digital is a leading video production company in Sri Lanka specializing in digital-first, high-performance video content designed for social media, advertising, and online growth.
