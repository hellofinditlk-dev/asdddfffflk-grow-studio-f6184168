const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is advertising in Sri Lanka?",
    a: "Advertising in Sri Lanka involves promoting products or services using both digital and traditional channels including Google Ads, social media platforms, TV, radio, billboards, and content marketing to reach target audiences effectively."
  },
  {
    q: "How much does advertising cost in Sri Lanka?",
    a: "Advertising costs vary depending on the platform and campaign type. Digital advertising can start from as little as LKR 10 per click on Google Ads, while social media campaigns can begin with budgets as low as LKR 500 per day. Costs depend on your goals, audience, and strategy."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best advertising platform in Sri Lanka?",
    a: "Google Ads and Facebook advertising are among the most effective platforms for reaching Sri Lankan audiences. The best platform depends on your business goals, target audience, and marketing budget."
  },
  {
    q: "How can small businesses advertise in Sri Lanka?",
    a: "Small businesses can use cost-effective digital advertising methods such as social media marketing, Google Ads, local SEO, and content marketing to compete with larger companies and reach local customers."
  },
  {
    q: "Why should I hire an advertising agency in Sri Lanka?",
    a: "A professional advertising agency brings expertise in strategy development, campaign management, creative production, and performance tracking. This helps businesses achieve better results and higher return on investment."
  },
  {
    q: "Which advertising method delivers the highest ROI?",
    a: "Digital advertising consistently delivers the highest ROI due to precise targeting, real-time tracking, and cost-effective campaign management. Google Ads and social media advertising are particularly effective for measurable results."
  },
  {
    q: "Is Google Ads effective for businesses in Sri Lanka?",
    a: "Yes — Google Ads targets high-intent users who are actively searching for products and services, making it one of the most effective advertising channels for generating leads and sales in Sri Lanka."
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to see results from advertising?",
    a: "Paid advertising (Google Ads, Facebook Ads) delivers immediate traffic and results. SEO and content marketing typically take 3–6 months to build significant organic visibility and traffic."
  },
  { q: "Can I target only people in Colombo with my ads?", a: "Yes. Both Facebook Ads and Google Ads let you target specific cities, provinces, or even a radius around your exact address — down to 1km. You can focus purely on Colombo, or narrow to specific areas like Nugegoda, Dehiwala, or Colombo 3." },
  { q: "Can I run ads in Sinhala in Sri Lanka?", a: "Yes, and for many industries it outperforms English. Facebook and Google both fully support Sinhala text. Sinhala ads typically generate stronger engagement outside Colombo and for mass-market products. Many successful advertisers run separate Sinhala and English campaigns targeting different segments." },
  { q: "Can I target tourists and foreign visitors in Sri Lanka?", a: "Yes. You can target people currently located in Sri Lanka by language (English, German, Chinese, etc.) to reach specific nationalities. This works especially well for hotels, tour operators, and restaurants near tourist areas." },
  { q: "What is the minimum budget to start advertising in Sri Lanka?", a: "You can start Facebook Ads from as little as LKR 500/day. However for meaningful results, we recommend a minimum of LKR 15,000–20,000 per month in ad spend. Below this, the platform algorithm does not have enough data to optimise properly." },
  { q: "How much do Sri Lankan businesses typically spend on advertising per month?", a: "Small businesses typically spend LKR 15,000–50,000/month. Growing businesses spend LKR 50,000–150,000. Established brands spend LKR 200,000–500,000+. These are ad spend figures — agency management fees are separate." },
  { q: "Is Facebook Advertising cheaper than Google Ads in Sri Lanka?", a: "Yes. Facebook Ads cost LKR 8–35 per click on average, while Google Ads cost LKR 40–300+ depending on industry. However Google often delivers higher intent leads because the person is actively searching for your service. The right platform depends on your business type, not just cost." },
  { q: "Is TikTok advertising effective for Sri Lankan businesses?", a: "Yes and it is growing fast. TikTok reaches a large portion of Sri Lanka's 18–35 demographic. Advertising costs are currently lower than Facebook because competition among local advertisers is still relatively low. Businesses in food, fashion, beauty, and entertainment are seeing strong results right now." },
  { q: "Does WhatsApp advertising work in Sri Lanka?", a: "Yes — WhatsApp is one of the most effective direct marketing tools in Sri Lanka given its extremely high usage across all age groups. The most powerful approach is running Click-to-WhatsApp ads on Facebook or Instagram that drive conversations directly into WhatsApp Business. Works especially well for real estate, education, and high-consideration purchases." },
  { q: "Should I use LinkedIn advertising for my Sri Lankan business?", a: "LinkedIn works well for B2B businesses — professional services, software, recruitment, and corporate training. It reaches approximately 2.9 million members in Sri Lanka. Costs are higher than Facebook but the audience quality for reaching managers and business decision-makers is unmatched." },
  { q: "What is the best platform for ecommerce advertising in Sri Lanka?", a: "A combination works best — Facebook and Instagram Ads for product discovery, and Google Shopping Ads for capturing people actively searching to buy. Adding retargeting campaigns on both platforms significantly improves conversion rates." },
  { q: "Why are my Facebook Ads not generating leads in Sri Lanka?", a: "The most common reasons are: audience targeting too broad, ad creative not compelling, landing page not mobile-optimised, wrong campaign objective (e.g. using Boost Post instead of Lead Generation), or budget too low for the algorithm to learn. Most underperforming campaigns can be fixed by improving the landing page and tightening the target audience." },
  { q: "How do I know if my advertising is actually working?", a: "Track three key metrics — cost per lead (spend per enquiry), lead-to-customer rate (how many enquiries convert), and return on ad spend (revenue vs money spent). Use Facebook Ads Manager, Google Ads dashboard, and Google Analytics together. Never judge a campaign on reach or impressions alone." },
  { q: "How long should I run an ad campaign before judging results?", a: "A minimum of 30 days. Facebook's algorithm needs approximately 50 conversion events to exit the learning phase. Stopping at day 5 or 10 means you are ending the campaign just as it starts to optimise. Major decisions should be made after 30–60 days of clean data." },
  { q: "Does advertising work differently in Sri Lanka compared to other countries?", a: "Yes, in several important ways. Facebook dominates far more strongly than in Western markets. Mobile traffic exceeds 85% so mobile-first creative is essential. Sinhala and Tamil language ads significantly outperform English for mass-market products. Seasonal peaks like Avurudu (April), Vesak, and Christmas drive major spikes in consumer spending and ad competition." },
  { q: "What industries get the best results from advertising in Sri Lanka?", a: "Service businesses with clear search intent — real estate, education, healthcare, legal — benefit most from Google Ads. Consumer businesses with visual products — restaurants, fashion, beauty, retail — benefit most from Facebook and Instagram. All business types benefit from consistent SEO as a long-term foundation." },
  { q: "Is advertising effective for small local businesses in Sri Lanka?", a: "Absolutely. Local Facebook and Google Ads with tight geographic targeting are some of the most cost-effective advertising options available to small businesses in Sri Lanka today. A small salon, bakery, or tuition class in Colombo can generate consistent leads with a LKR 20,000–30,000 monthly budget managed properly." },
  { q: "What should I look for when choosing an advertising agency in Sri Lanka?", a: "Look for proven results with real client examples, transparent reporting, clear pricing with no hidden fees, and local market knowledge. Ask to see actual ad account screenshots — not just polished case study PDFs. Avoid agencies that guarantee #1 on Google or promise unrealistically low costs." },
  { q: "Can I manage my own advertising in Sri Lanka without an agency?", a: "Yes, both Facebook Ads Manager and Google Ads are self-serve platforms. However, without experience you will likely spend significant budget in the learning phase making avoidable mistakes. Most businesses find that a good agency pays for itself by reducing wasted spend and generating better quality leads from the same budget." },
  { q: "Are there restrictions on advertising content in Sri Lanka?", a: "Yes. Advertising is subject to the Consumer Affairs Authority Act and industry-specific regulations. Misleading claims, unsubstantiated health claims, and certain financial promotions require specific disclosures. Facebook and Google also apply their own global policies — alcohol, gambling, health supplements, and financial products face additional restrictions and may require pre-approval." },
  { q: "Do I need a registered business to advertise in Sri Lanka?", a: "You do not need a registered business to run Facebook or Google Ads — a personal account works. However running campaigns under a registered business name is recommended for credibility and tax purposes. Google also has an advertiser verification programme requiring identity documents for certain ad categories." }
